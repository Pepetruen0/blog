This is a simple blog theme for an upcoming personal Wordpress project. It is being developed using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as the main task runner along with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) , [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)  and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)  as the grid framework. Responsive breakpoints are handled through [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/) . The main motivation behind this project is to get familiar with the above mentioned tools as well as Github, which I had neglected for long enough. It is worth mentioning that this is by no means an advanced project, it is meant as a beginner project to get used to the tools of the trade.

## Usage:
Just clone and run npm install so you get the main npm modules. Afterwards, you just need to run grunt with no arguments to start the default watch task.

##To do:
- Add a secondary catlist area
- Implement breakpoint
- Add responsiveness
- Fix footer
- Create single post view
- Fix typography
- Implement vertical rhythm
