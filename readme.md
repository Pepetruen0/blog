This is a simple blog theme for an upcoming personal Wordpress project. It is being developed using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as the main task runner along with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) , [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)  and [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)  as the grid framework. Responsive breakpoints are handled through [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/) . The main motivation behind this project is to get familiar with the above mentioned tools as well as Github, which I had neglected for long enough. It is worth mentioning that this is by no means an advanced project, it is meant as a beginner project to get used to the tools of the trade.

## Usage:
Just clone and run npm install so you get the main npm modules. Afterwards, you just need to run grunt with no arguments to start the default watch task.

##To do:
- ~~Rework main menu~~
- ~~Implement breakpoint~~
- ~~Add responsiveness~~
- ~~Fix footer~~
- ~~Create single post view~~
- ~~Fix typography~~
- Implement vertical rhythm

#Note Note Note
At this point, Wordpress has been installed on my main development machine. This means that the /build folder has been deprecated and in favor of a directory a level above the main project scope. This is because the project now resides in the themes folder of a wordpress install and everything is starting to build as a normal theme.
